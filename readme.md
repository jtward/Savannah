Savannah
===================

Savannah is a web-native bridge for hybrid apps with a plugin architecture, similar to Apache Cordova.

The main difference between Savannah and Cordova is that Savannah cares only about the webviews in your app that you hook up to use Savannah, whereas Cordova cares about your entire app. This means that Savannah is more appropriate for apps whose interfaces are not just single webviews.

Savannah is currently a proof of concept and not yet ready for production.
